# history

## Command history in Zsh@unix.stackexchange.com[^1]

## ZSH - output whole history?[^2]

## fzf by Junegunn Choi[^3]

Have a look at fzf. It helps not only finding "whatever-particles" in your shell history, but also in other interesting places, e.g. browser history, directory history, etc.

fzf is a command-line fuzzy finder. That means you can search for particles or fractions of what you are looking for and it will display a collection of matches which you can continuously refine. It's really a game changer.

The homepage of the author contains a number of illustrative examples.
